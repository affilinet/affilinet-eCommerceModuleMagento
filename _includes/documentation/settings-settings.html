<p>If you have already an affilinet account, you can start immediately. Enter your affilinet programID, your webservice login details as well as your company logo in the settings and choose your currency. For multi-store installations the configuration of the extension will be passed on, but can be adjusted individually for individual stores.</p>

<h4>Use of Magento Multistores</h4>
<p>You have the option to use Magento Multistore installations for the extension. As usual you can define the settings for different scopes. Specific website settings will be applied to the website store views. Magento Multistore installations provide very flexible configuration options, since all extension settings can be defined in the store view.</p>

<h4>Logo upload</h4>
<p>The maximum required logo size is 120 x 40 px. Bigger images will automatically be scaled to this size. Therefore we recommend only uploading logos with this size.</p>
<p class="text-primary">Please note: The currency of the German affilinet platform is Euro. If you define a foreign currency in the settings, the amounts will be converted in Euro (based on to the daily exchange rate) and accordingly displayed in the affilinet portal. Therefor the "currency conversion" must be activated by affilinet. Please contact the affilinet Support at <a href="mailto:support@affili.net">support@affili.net</a>.</p>

<h4>Basket Tracking</h4>
<p>The affilinet basket tracking system allows you to submit shopping basket information on item level to affilinet. That information enables you to perform detailed statistical analyses and allows your publishers to optimize their marketing activities even further.</p>
<p>In the affilinet basket tracking system, we distinguish between baskets and basket items. Baskets can be confirmed and cancelled like regular transactions, but before you do this, you can update the contained basket items: you can update the quantity of single items or remove single items from the basket (e.g. if the article was returned by the customer); the publisher’s commission is automatically updated.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the baskets even better, you can activate two additional tracking parameters (psub 1,2) in the cart tracking settings, which are only visible for the advertiser (you). You can specify whether you want to submit Magento default values as payment method or shipping method to be displayed in your statistics.</p>
<p>As product attributes you can submit additional parameters for the basket items as e. g. size, color, material etc.. These attributes will also be displayed in the publisher’s statistics for optimization purposes. Please transfer only data, which should be visible for publishers as well.</p>

<h4>Standard Sale Tracking</h4>
<p>Tracking is the basis of affiliate marketing, enabling you to register your orders which have been generated by affilinet publishers.</p>
<p>Furthermore it enables the advertiser to pay a publisher commission also, if the customer buys not before the second or another shop visit within a certain time.</p>

<p class="text-primary">Please note: The rates are submitted through affilinet webservices. If you didn't provide your affilinet webservice login data in the module area, no data will be delivered.</p>

<h4>Retargeting</h4>
<p>This technology enables you to re-address specifically interested customers. Potential customers, who left your online shop without a purchase, can be returned to your store via personalized ads (e. g. dynamic product banners). These ads will be displayed through affilinet retargeting publishers within their media reach.</p>

<p>In the settings area you find the Retargeting configuration, the possibility to activate retargeting as well as to configurate optional parameters.</p>

<h4>Product datafeed</h4>
<p>For many shop products, feeds must be generated within several steps.</p>
<p>Here you can define the number of products, which should be processed per step.</p>
